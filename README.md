There are the exact reasons of why I love coding as well. But I am not so good so sometimes I find it to be very frustrating. I have list the 6 reasons down below.
1. The sheer joy of making things.
2. The pleasure of making things that are useful to other peopl
3. The fascination of fashioning complex puzzle like objects of interlocking moving parts, and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles buildi in from the beginning.
4. The joy of always learning, which spring from the nonrepeating nature of the task.
5. The delight of working in such a tractabel medium. 
6. The repressiveness of code
